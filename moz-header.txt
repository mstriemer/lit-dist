 * This file is vendored from https://github.com/mstriemer/lit-dist/blob/custom-export/mozdist/lit.all.js.
 * If changes are required, they happen in import_all.js in that repo and then `moz-build-helper.sh` and
 * the following change is made (which is now automated):
 *
 * There is an innerHTML usage which does not work with our sanitization of
 * innerHTML. When updating this file that needs to be changed to the following
 * (in static createElement currently a member of U):
 *
 * static createElement(t,e){
 *   const parser = new DOMParser();
 *   const doc = parser.parseFromString(
 *     `<template>${t}</template>`,
 *     "text/html"
 *   );
 *   let i = document.importNode(doc.querySelector("template"), true);
 *   return i;
 * }
